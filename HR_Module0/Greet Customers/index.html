    <h2>Greet Customers</h2>

    <h3>Write a function called "greetCustomer".</h3>

    <p>Given a name, "greetCustomer" returns a greeting based on how many times that customer has visited the restaurant.  Please refer to the customerData object.</p>

    <p>Given a name, "greetCustomer" returns a greeting based on how many times that customer has visited the restaurant. Please refer to the customerData object.</p>

    <p>The greeting should be different, depending on the name on their reservation.</p>

    <p>Case 1 - Unknown customer ( Name is not present in customerData ):</p>

    <p>var output = greetCustomer('Terrance');</p>

    <p>console.log(output); // --> 'Welcome! Is this your first time?'</p>

    <p>Case 2 - Customer who has visited only once ( 'visits' value is 1 ):</p>

    <p>var output = greetCustomer('Joe');</p>

    <p>console.log(output); // --> 'Welcome back, Joe! We're glad you liked us the first time!'</p>

    <p>Case 3 - Repeat customer: ( 'visits' value is greater than 1 ):</p>

    <p>var output = greetCustomer('Carol');</p>

    <p>console.log(output); // --> 'Welcome back, Carol! So glad to see you again!'</p>

    <p>Notes:</p>

    <p>* Your function should not alter the customerData object to update the number of visits.</p>

    <p>* Do not hardcode to the exact sample data. This is a BAD IDEA:</p>

    <p>if (firstName === 'Joe') {
        // do something
    }</p>


    <script>
    
    const customerData = {
        'Joe': {
            visits: 1
        },
        'Carol': {
            visits: 2
        },
        'Howard': {
            visits: 3
        },
        'Carrie': {
            visits: 4
        }
    };

    const greetCustomer = firstName => {
        let greeting = "";

        if (!customerData[firstName]) {
            greeting = "Welcome! Is this your first time?";
        } else if (customerData[firstName].visits === 1) {
            greeting = "Welcome back, " + firstName + "! We're glad you liked us the first time!";
        } else if (customerData[firstName].visits >= 2) {
            greeting = "Welcome back, " + firstName + "! So glad to see you again!"
        }
        return greeting;
    }
    console.log(greetCustomer("Carrie"));
    </script>
